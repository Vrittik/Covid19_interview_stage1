# Covid19_interview_stage1
So ,its covid -19 pandemic and all i think is students are finding it difficult to get internship through platforms like internshala  , so I've decided to make a virtual interviewer for shortlisting people on the basis of their answers in the chatbot and AI web cam interview.  This is the stage 1 of the interview in which a chat bot ( made with angular js , dialogFlow, restAPI , Node js) is asking basic questions about interests and experience of the individual and storing the results in firebase.   Here is a short video of the interviewing chat bot ( stage -1 interview)  Stage 2 interview would be a webcam interview in which i would try to predict the emotions and tone of a person while answering questions.  Note : This chat bot is made through dialogFlow ,so it uses NLP and is not biased only for certain lines , it detects the entity in the line so its can also be called AI chat Bot.
